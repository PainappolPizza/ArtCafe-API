# ArtCafe-API

## Geocaching with extra steps (and coffee!)

ArtCafe is a geocaching app that allows you to find and create geocaches.
It is a work in progress, and is currently in the alpha stage. 
It is not yet ready for production use.

Build for the Software Engineering course @FH IMC Krems.

### Test the API at:
* [deployment](https://artcafe-api-production.up.railway.app/docs)
* [locally]('https://www.uvicorn.org')
